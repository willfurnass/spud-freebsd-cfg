- name: Ensure taskd package installed
  pkgng: name=taskd state=present

# See taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/configure.html for configuration information. 

# After completing configuration to start taskd at system startup add taskd_enable="YES" to rc.conf. 
# If you configured taskd with a TASKDDATA other than /var/db/taskd you will also need to set taskd_data in rc.conf to that path.

# The rc script will start taskd as the unprivileged user taskd, 
# this requires that your TASKDDATA directory and /var/log/taskd.log be owned by taskd:taskd. 
# If you prefer to use another user specify this in rc.conf using taskd_user.

# To add users see: taskwarrior.org/docs/taskserver/user.html
